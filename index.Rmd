Dear visitor,

Welcome to the website of the Improving Pancreatic Cancer Care by the Use of Computational Science and Technology (IMPACT) Consortium!

Revolutionary developments in data science, such as the emergence of artificial intelligence, have a great potential to provide a solution for current obstacles in pancreatic cancer care. These innovative technologies are expected to bring profound contributions to improving diagnostic modalities and treatment strategies in the upcoming years. 

The primary goal of the IMPACT Consortium is to enable the collection and sharing of large amounts of data for training, testing and validation of computer science tools to improve quality of care for patients with pancreatic cancer through collaboration of expert centers for pancreatic cancer care.

This website shows the meta-data of datasets that are available upon reasonable request, refers to the public Github repository in which source code of projects conducted by the IMPACT Consortium partners can be found, and shows sub-projects that are currently ongoing. 

On behalf of all participating centers,
Dr. L.A. Daamen, MD, PhD (Project Leader)
